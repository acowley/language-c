# Important Note

This is a fork of the `language-c` package to provide compatibility
with OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). The original package is unmaintained,
which breaks downstream clients such as `c2hs` on 10.9 when working
with current versions of certain header files (e.g. OpenCL, OpenGL).

The original README is below.

= Language.C =

Language.C is a parser and pretty-printer framework for C99 and the extensions of gcc.

See http://www.sivity.net/projects/language.c/
